About us statement

One of the major problems with the organization of the University of Pittsburgh’s website is that the resources that they offer their students are spread out across different areas of their website.  Some resources are not even on the website!  We decided to create a website with all of the resources that Pitt offers its students in a way that makes it as efficient as possible to find the resource you are looking for.  This allows students to get their money’s worth out of the school without having to search multiple websites for hours just to find where you can rent out a camera or any other resource.  We want to create a website that is accessible to all who wish to use it and one that is as easy and convenient to navigate as possible.  Our goal is to make finding the resources need as easy as can be so that students can spend more time working and less time searching.
