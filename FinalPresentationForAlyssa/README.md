# Elevator Pitch Generator

It's true. The Greeks invented the elevator, and quickly realized the awkward communication that results when one is locked in a box with their interlocutor. Luckily, in addition to being great engineers, the Greeks were also skilled rhetoricians.

Open this generator and follow the directions to utilize the available means of persuasion to concisely language exactly what you want to say. The result: an elevator pitch. Ding! - Doors Closing - How high do you want to go?"

## Get started!

1. Go to the Elevator Pitch repository: [HERE](https://github.com/Pitt-Fuego/elevator-pitch-generator)

2. Click "Code" then "Download ZIP" to your local computer. 

3. Find this folder in your downloads. Move this folder to a secure place. You will return to this folder to manage your scripts and other assets like images, pdfs, etcetera. 

4. Download and/or open a text editor like [brackets.io](https://brackets.io), [atom.io](https://atom.io), or [notepad-plus-plus.org](notepad-plus-plus.org). 

5. Use the text editor to open the style.css and index.html documents from your project folder.  

6. Start working with code by reading through the index.html where you'll find instructions on how to build your own web text! 

7. Once you have modified and added your files to your project file, you will want to publish to the web. GitHub provides a good solution for "free." Create a GitHub account, then create a new repository for this webtext. Click  "uploading an existing file," (push) your files into this repository. You'll need ALL of your assets to make your webtext function properly. Upload assets, then hit "Commit changes." 

9. Now go to your repository "settings." Scroll down to "GitHub Pages" and change the setting from "none" to "main." Hit "Save"

10. This will provide you with a published GitHub URL.

11. Test the URL in a browser. Magic, no? Actually, it's computer science.
