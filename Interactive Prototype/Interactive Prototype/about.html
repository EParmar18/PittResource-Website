        <h1>About Pitt Resource Hub</h1>
            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <h3>One of the major problems with the organization of the University of Pittsburgh’s website is that the
                resources that they offer their students are spread out across different areas of their website.
                Some resources are not even on the website! We decided to create a website with all of the resources that
                Pitt offers its students in a way that makes it as efficient as possible to find the resource you are looking for.
                This allows students to get their money’s worth out of the school without having to search multiple websites for hours
                just to find where you can rent out a camera or any other resource. We want to create a website that is accessible to all
                who wish to use it and one that is as easy and convenient to navigate as possible. Our goal is to make finding the resources
                need as easy as can be so that students can spend more time working and less time searching.</h3>
            <h4>Inclusivity Statement</h4>
            <h5>Our website is for anyone and everyone to use and/or build upon. Our vision for this website is to create an organized, easy to use for everyone, 
                University of Pittsburgh resource page. We only ask that future contributors keep our vision of creating a website for all walks of life in mind.</h5>
