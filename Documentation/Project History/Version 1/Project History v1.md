Project History v1

Our first goal was to cast a big a net as possible to gather as many resources Pitt has as possible.  All the resources we gathered are in a readme in the Github repository.  We created tasks after we gathered the resources and assigned roles to ourselves based upon our abilities.  Maya and Eshan had coding experience so they got the task of coding the actual website.  Joe was in charge of design and he also created all the icons.  Alyssa and Gabe were the document writers and Alyssa created the presentation and Gabe created the project history and other documents.  Eshan had made a website design in Adobe XD for us to look at, tweak, and use as a big influence in our design.  Joe finished the icons and Maya had the basic code for the website done so she added the icons and that was our first version of our website.  We continued to create icons and as a group discuss our design every step of the way.
